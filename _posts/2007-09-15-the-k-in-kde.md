title: The K in KDE
---
This was an interesting tidbit that showed up in the hints on login to SUSE.
<blockquote>The K in KDE does not stand for anything. It is the character that comes before L in the Latin alphabet, which stands for Linux. It was chosen because KDE runs on many types of UNIX (and perfectly well on FreeBSD). </blockquote>
