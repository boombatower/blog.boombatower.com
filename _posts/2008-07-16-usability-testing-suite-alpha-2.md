title: Usability Testing Suite Alpha 2
---
I have released the second alpha of the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/uts">Usability Testing Suite</a>. The API is fully functional and there are two plug-ins implementing the API. The reason the module is still marked as alpha is due to the user flow issues and clean-up items.

For more detailed information on the status of the project please read the <a href="http://drupal.org/node/283476">alpha 2 release notes</a>.

I would like to get feedback on what people think of the module, as it is intended to be used to enhance Drupal's usability.

Make sure you read the INSTALL.txt file before installing.
