After my most recent post concerning the <a href="/testbed-design-change-and-development">Testbed design change and development</a> I received a number of comments that lead me to believe that the post was misunderstood. The comments suggest that the readers believe my primary focus of development will be changing from a push to a pull model. The post seems to have been misleading in that regard.

The change to a pull architecture is a very minor change in terms of coding, only 2 functions are even effected, but in terms of managing the network it helps out a lot. The majority of the development, that I am <a href="http://boombatower.chipin.com/automated-testing-system-development">raising $3000 for</a>, will be focused on implementing the ideas described in <a href="/the-future-of-automated-patch-testing">The Future of Automated Patch Testing</a>. The feature additions will:
<ul>
<li>Give more control to server administrators (donated servers)</li>
<li>Make it easier to manage the automated testing framework</li>
<li>Allow for testing of multiple environment configurations</li>
<li>Open up testing of Drupal 6 core and contrib code.</li>
</ul>

I hope this has cleared up any misconceptions with the automated testing system as it stands and my plans for its feature.

I appreciate any donations.
