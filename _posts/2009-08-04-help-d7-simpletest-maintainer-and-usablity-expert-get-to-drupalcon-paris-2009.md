The <a href="http://paris2009.drupalcon.org/blog/scholarships-announced">scholarships</a> provided by the <a href="http://paris2009.drupalcon.org">Drupalcon Paris team</a> will not cover all the accommodation expenses. <a href="http://drupal.org/user/87969">Bojhan</a> and <a href="http://drupal.org/user/214218">myself (boombatower)</a> have decided to stay together and share the expenses. In order to make it to Paris we need to raise at least $500 USD, otherwise I will not be attending.

Take a look at our user pages to get an idea of the work we have done for Drupal.

I plan to give two sessions: <a href="http://paris2009.drupalcon.org/session/introduction-testing-drupal-simpletest">Introduction to testing with Drupal: SimpleTest</a> and <a href="http://paris2009.drupalcon.org/session/sept-2nd-drupal-7-relase-party-how-continuous-integration-testing-made-plausible">Sept 2nd, Drupal 7 release party. How continuous integration testing made this plausible</a>.

Bojhan has two presentation proposals as well: <a href="http://paris2009.drupalcon.org/session/building-blocks-your-modules-ui">Building blocks for your module's UI</a> and <a href="http://paris2009.drupalcon.org/session/how-open-design-will-drive-drupal-8">How Open Design will drive Drupal 8</a>.

We appreciate your <a href="http://www.chipin.com/contribute/id/6238d4a38871fb20">donations</a> and hope to accomplish much at Drupalcon Paris.
