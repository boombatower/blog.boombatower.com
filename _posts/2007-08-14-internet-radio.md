I enjoy Internet radio through Amarok. Instead of picking songs off the web, cds, etc. a playlist will be sent to you and the music streamed to your computer.

To use Amarok to listen to Internet radio simply open Ameriok. Alt+F2 then type <i>amarok</i>. (or in the menus under Multimedia->Audio Player->Amarok or just Multimedia->Amarok) After Amarok loads select <i>Playlists</i> from the left tabs, then drop down <i>Radio Streams</i>.

You can add your own or look at the <i>Cool-Streams</i> that come with Amarok. Simply select one of the streams by double clicking it. The playlist will download and then you can choose one of the streams to listen to.
