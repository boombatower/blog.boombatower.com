Good to see Firefox getting some media coverage, considering it superiority to Internet Explorer and the growing, highly dedicated fan base it has.

Looking forward to Firefox 3. Between Firefox 3 and Internet Explorer 8 the two browsers will be taking totally different paths. IE will become more proprietary (of course) by integrating into many of Microsoft's proprietary products, while Firefox will attempt to be more than a browsers, instead becoming an general Internet tool with many innovative features.
