title: The Infamous "Blue Screen Of Death"

Recently a friend asked what BSOD meant. So I figure I would see what google thought and entered
<blockquote>define: BSOD</blockquote>into google and wala there it was.
<blockquote>Blue Screen Of Death.
</blockquote>The last <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSoD">article</a> was from WikiPedia. It talks the history of the <i>Blue Screen</i> and has some entertaining examples of the <i>Blue Screen</i> in action.
