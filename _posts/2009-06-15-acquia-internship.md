This Summer I will be working part-time as an intern for <a href="http://acquia.com/">Acquia</a>. I am very excited to be working with Acquia and having the chance to spend more time improving things that I have interest in. To clarify I will be working on projects that benefit the entire Drupal community. The items I will be working on are improvements to projects I have either started or that I am heavily involved with.

During the discussion of the internship I came up with the following goals that were then prioritized by <a href="http://drupal.org/user/1">Dries</a>.

<b>Primary goals</b>
<ul>
<li>Finalize testing of contributed modules and Drupal 6.x projects/core.</li>
<li>Add executive summary of test results on project page.</li>
<li>Extend the SimpleTest framework so we can test the installer and update/upgrade system.</li>
<li>Improve and organize SimpleTest documentation</li>
<li>Work on general enhancement of Drupal 7 SimpleTest.</li>
</ul>

<b>Secondary goals</b>
<ul>
<li>Provide on-demand patch testing environment for human review of patches.</li>
<li>Finish refactoring of SimpleTest to allow for a clean implementation of "configuration" testing.</li>
<li>Analyze current test quality and code coverage, and foster work in areas requiring attention.</li>
</ul>

I will post updates on some of the more interesting items as they are accomplished. Additionally, I would like to give a special thanks to <a href="http://drupal.org/user/18703">Kieran Lal</a> for his mentoring and help in finding me sponsorship.

FOLLOW UP:
To clarify I will still be participating in Google Summer of Code 2009, which was explicit in my agreement with Acquia.
