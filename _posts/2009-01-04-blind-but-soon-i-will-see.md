The graphics card on my development machine died New Years Eve and thus I am without a development environment for the time being. I will order a new graphics card and a few other parts today or tomorrow so I should be back in business within the week.

Sorry for any delays in development.

Thanks for the support. (chx has graciously donated to my cause. :) )
