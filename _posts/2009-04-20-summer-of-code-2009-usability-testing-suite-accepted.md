title: Summer of Code 2009 - Usability Testing Suite - Accepted
---
Google <a href="http://socghop.appspot.com/org/home/google/gsoc2009/drupal">announced the accepted student proposals</a> today, of which <a href="http://socghop.appspot.com/student_project/show/google/gsoc2009/drupal/t124022213209">my proposal</a> was included. The project will finalize the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/uts">Usability Testing Suite</a> which was started during <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/11011">Summer of Code 2008</a>. At the conclusion of this year's Summer of Code I hope to have the project ready for prime time use which will make it easier to conduct a number of different usability studies.

For a bit more detail on the project I have included the project abstract.
<blockquote>
The Usability Testing Suite that I created during SoC 2008 needs additional work in order to make it ready for use. The existing module provides a powerful API that makes writing data collection plug-ins simple, but the user interface needs refinement and a screen recording plug-in would make the module much more helpful. Through this project I intend to finalize the Usability Testing Suite and make it ready for widespread use.

On another note, <a href="http://drupal.org/user/240748">my father</a> was also <a href="http://socghop.appspot.com/student_project/show/google/gsoc2009/drupal/t124022215040">accepted</a>! As confirmed by <a href="http://drupal.org/user/9446">Károly "chx" Négyesi</a> we are the first <i>father-son</i> pair to be accepted into Summer of Code.

I have attached the full project proposal that I submitted.
