title: Google speech recognition - Android Face?
---
I accidentally stumbled across this _easter egg_ of sorts in Googles speech recognition on both Android and using the [web speech API](http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/demos/speech.html).

![Google speech recognition - Android Face](/files/webspeech-android-face.png)

Saying just _android_ or _face_ or _droid face_ results in the expected words, but _android face_ just like the other supported [emoticon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoticon) faces (like _smilely face_) results in a text face.
