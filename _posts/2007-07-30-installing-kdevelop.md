title: Installing KDevelop

Recently I have begun work in C++ and decided I wanted the most up to date version of KDevelop. So I looked in YAST but it wasn't the newest. The easiest way to get and maintain up to date version is to add a source containing KDevelop to YAST.

Add the following source to YaST. If you are new to adding installation sources please refer to <a href="http://boombatower.blogspot.com/2007/07/adding-yast-installtion-sources.html">Adding YaST Installation Sources</a>.
<blockquote>http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/KDE:/Backports/openSUSE_10.2/x86_64</blockquote>Then goto <span style="font-style: italic;">Software Management</span> and install <span style="font-style: italic;">KDevelope</span>. YAST will then maintain your version by alerting you to updates and allowing you to install them with a single click.

A good tutorial I used is: <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/">http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/</a>
