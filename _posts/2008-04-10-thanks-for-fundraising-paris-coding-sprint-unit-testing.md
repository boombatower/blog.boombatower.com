title: Thanks for Fundraising - Paris Coding Sprint - Unit Testing

I will be attending the Paris Coding Sprint to work on unit testing for Drupal 7 thanks to those who generously supported me and Google. <a href="http://www.hawthornlandings.org/">Leslie Hawthorn</a> was able to secure funding from Google to sponsor both <a href="http://drupal.org/user/157412">Charlie Gordon</a> and <a href="http://drupal.org/user/214218">Jimmy Berry (me)</a>. Another thanks to those who gave generously to help me get to the sprint.
<ul>
<li>Greg Dunlap</li>
<li>Josh Koenig</li>
<li>Michael Anello</li>
<li>Thomas Moseler</li>
<li>Kent Bye</li>
<li>Paul Chvostek</li>
<li>Bonnie Bogle (Development Seed)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Thanks!</h2>

The sprint will attempt to get a jump start on unit testing in order to <a href="http://buytaert.net/drupal-7-timeline">postpone the code freeze</a> for Drupal 7. This is a crucial initiative in advancing Drupal as a whole.

For more information on the sprint see <a href="wants-to-goto-paris">my previous post</a>.
