title: Drupalcon DC - Automated testing - Saving webchick time - the saga
---
I will be presenting <a href="http://dc2009.drupalcon.org/session/saving-webchick-time-saga">Saving webchick time - the saga</a> along with Kieran Lal at <a href="http://dc2009.drupalcon.org">Drupalcon DC 2009</a>. To quote the session abstract:
<blockquote>
One of the major enhancements made to the Drupal development cycle has been the addition of a fully automated testing bot, built on the testing framework in Drupal 7.

This session will focus on automated testing as it relates to Drupal 7: its history and direction, the automated testing bot: what has gone into it and where the future leads, and most importantly what is the end gain to the Drupal community.
</blockquote>

The framework has gone through a rather long and interesting history with a number of road-blocks and challenges that have been overcome. The session will tell the story of the framework and the benefits it provides to the community through the enhanced Drupal 7 development work-flow. Although the session will go into some technical details it will overall tell the story of the framework and where we plan to take it. The presentation should be interesting to most and provide a great time to throw out any comments or concerns.

After the presentation I will stick around to discuss our recent launch of the <a href="http://boombatower.com/news/automated-testing">Boombatower Testing Service (BTS)</a>. If you have any questions, comments, or concerns please drop by.
