title: Unreal Tournament 2004 on 64 bit Linux
---
I successfully installed Unreal Tournament 2004 on SUSE 10.2 and was able to run it with about twice the framerate I get on Windows XP. Next I decided to update Unreal so that I could play multiplayer. After doing so I was no longer able to start the game.

I messed with file permissions and searched the web with little results. Finally I decided to post my problem in the Unreal Forums (<http://forums.epicgames.com/showthread.php?p=24929389>).

It was figured out that the problem was due to the fact that I was running 64 bit SUSE. The fix was simple as is described in the thread posted above.
