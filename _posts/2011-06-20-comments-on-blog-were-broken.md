The reCAPTCHA decided to stop working on my blog. Robert Douglass was kind enough to notify me of the problem. I fixed the problem, but suspect I may have missed some good feedback on my most recent post, <a href="/reflections-on-drupal-quality-assurance">Reflections on Drupal Quality Assurance</a>. If you had intended to comment, please revisit the post.
