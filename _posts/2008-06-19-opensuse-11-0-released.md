title: openSUSE 11.0 Released!
---
The latests and greatest version of openSUSE has been released. I have been waiting for SUSE 11.0 for some time and will be upgrading immediately. I have already backed up my system and have begun downloading the 64 bit DVD via torrent.

This release has been praised as the <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=8988">Mercedes-Benz of Linux</a>. The release has lots of updated programs, new features, and performance upgrades.
