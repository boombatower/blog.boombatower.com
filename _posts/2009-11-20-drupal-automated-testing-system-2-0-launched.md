title: Drupal automated testing system 2.0 launched
---
You may or may not have noticed the <a href="http://qa.drupal.org/node/60">launch of the second iteration</a> of the Drupal automated testing system last Thursday. I am very excited to have the system up and running and by the possibilities it opens up.

In order to help others get a feel for some of the new features that it provides and how the features can be used I created a screencast covering some of visual changes and features provided to end-users.
