SUSE now offers a web search that allows you to find programs and their respective repositories. The one-click install will be implemented in SUSE 10.3, although there are ways to make it work in SUSE 10.2.

I use the search tool to find the repositories that I need for the specific programs I want. Once you find what you are looking for simple on the link in the upper right of each search result. This will take you to the address of that repository.

For example if you search for <i>eclipse</i> the link in the upper right is <i>Java:addon/openSUSE_10.2</i>. After you click the link it will take you to the following url: <i>http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Java:/addon/openSUSE_10.2/</i>.

You can then use the url to add a source to YaST. For instruction please see <a href="/adding-yast-installtion-sources">Adding YaST Installation Sources</a>.
