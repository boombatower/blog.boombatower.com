title: Kopete for Google Talk
---
Due to <a href="http://talk.google.com">Google Talk</a>'s lack of support for Linux or Mac users are forced to use the gmail AJAX interface or the flash gadget. Personally I don't like having them open in my browser and neither of them have the capabilities of an application.

So I decided to see if it was possible to setup Kopete, a common Linux chat program, to work with Google Talk. As I found out it was very simple.

This <a href="http://wiki.kde.org/tiki-index.php?page=Google+Talk+support">article</a> describes how to set it up.
